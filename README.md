A simple 3D app I wrote while doing my Bachelor's thesis. Features:

* Stage3D (+Alternativa3D) used for rendering.
* First person shooter-like camera.
* Basic P2P support using Adobe Cirrus (multiple clients can connect).
* Spatial partitioning using octrees.

I used to load some extracted Half-Life 2: Deatchmatch maps for testing the app, those are not included for obvious reasons.
